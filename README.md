# TCS DAPP Project

This project demonstrates a basic DAPP use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm install
npm run
npm run dev
npm run build

```
